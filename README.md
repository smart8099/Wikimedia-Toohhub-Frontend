## Design Thought Process
To design this demo application, I wrote User Stories to represent the major functionalities in the web application. Below are the User Stories I implemented:

### User Stories
> As a potential toolhub editor, I want to be able to search the tool of my choice, so I can know
and provide data for the tool's missing fields.

> As a potential toolhub editor, I want to be able to see tools with missing fields, so I can easily provide data for those tools without searching.

> As a potential toolhub editor, I want to be able to see the leadersboard, so that I will know the top editors in the last 30 days.  

> As a potential toolhub editor, I want to be able to see displayed statistics of toolhub, so I can have an overview of what is currently happening in toolhub.
